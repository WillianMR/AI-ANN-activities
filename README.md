# Academic Notebooks and Python Code Solutions

Welcome to the repository for practical solutions and exercises related to courses in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, and **Pattern Recognition**. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts developed as part of my Master's program at the [Federal Institute of Esp√≠rito Santo](https://www.ifes.edu.br/), specifically focusing on advanced AI topics.

## Overview

This repository showcases various implementations, exercises, and assignments for core topics in AI and machine learning. Each notebook or script is a self-contained solution to a specific problem or exercise, with an emphasis on:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Search algorithms, optimization, machine learning models, etc.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Feature extraction, classification, clustering, and pattern analysis.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Perceptrons, multilayer networks, backpropagation, and deep learning architectures.

The following libraries are frequently used across exercises:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` / `pytorch` (for ANN and deep learning exercises)


## Contributing

This repository serves as a collection of solutions and examples for personal academic use. However, contributions to enhance, optimize, or expand these solutions are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to open a pull request or submit issues for review.
